Rule:
-Try different version of Rule generation that does not need a random number but instead randoms the next state
 for every pattern
 
 CellNeighborhood:
 -This class is nice to have as it keeps BaseBInteger separate from CellLogic?
 -Better Idea: Make BaseBCellInteger class that operates directly on cells?! -> No conversion from
  vector<Cell> to vector<double> needed
  
 BaseBInteger:
 -Make template class out of it?

The CellRow class has been reworked fundamentally with this commit. It is now a concrete class rather than
an abstract base class to inherit from. BoundedCellRow is no longer necessary (but not yet deleted, that will
be done with the next commit) as the logic to handle bounds as well as the CellVector are now handled by
CellRow itself. CellRow now consists of three major components:

- cells_					the list of Cells wrapped by CellRow
- boundaryComponent_		the component handling the boundaries. This can be set to eg BoundedCellRowBoundaryComponent,
							which makes the CellRow function like BoundedCellRow used to in handling boundary cells
- cellNeighborhoodCreator_	the CellNeighborhoodCreator, creating CellNeighborhoods around a given center

The CellRowBoundaryComponent class now takes care of the boundaries. It is an abstract base class and has two methods
for retrieving cells beyond the bounds of the cells_ CellVector. It is used by the corresponding cellNeighborhoodCreator_
to retrieve cells for making neighborhoods that cut the boundaries.






Plan:
CellRow:
-delete member rule_, it is not needed as the rule is saved in the CellNeighborhoodCreator

CellNeighborhood
-No longer needed, CellVector is returned now instead -> Rule takes care of encoding the returned CellVector

Classes scheduled for deletion, since they are no longer needed:
-BoundedCellRow
-CellRowStub
-CellRowIterator
-CellNeighborhood
